                <p>My name is Carlos Sebastian Fuentes. Currently I am a NJIT student in my sophomore year. Originally I was a computer science major however I decided to change my major to IT this year. Next semester, I would become a junior with the credits I should be recieving by the end of the fall semester hopefully. So hobbies I enjoy would be listening to music and hanging out with friends. </p>
                <p>So far in the years of NJIT, I would say it has been a decent experience. I've met a few cool people around that I hang out with from time to time. The workload can get pretty hefty and pile up if you do not keep up with it. However, some professors understand and would work with you if you talk to them. Overall, I'd say my time in NJIT has been decent.</p>
