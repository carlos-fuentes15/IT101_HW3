                    <li>Information is provided twice</li>
                    <li>Background color does not match</li>
                    <li>The website was probably made for phone users as the alignment of the content is off</li>
                    <li>When I press "read more" about a certain topic, it does not give me a description of what they provide</li>
                    <li>They tried to align the text with the shapes in some cases however it did not align well at all</li>
                    <li>When you click on one of the options in the navigation tab, you can't scoll up or down the page to go back to the front page</li>
                    <li>They changed the color of the background between the different options in navigation tab.</li>
                    <li>Front of the page contains mostly images with no description</li>
                    <li>The whole layout seems to be all cluttered up, making it harder for the user to be enertained</li>
